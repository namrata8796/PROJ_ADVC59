            <p>
                My name is Namrata and I love drawing.
                <br><br>
                Because amidst the chaos of life, for me, creativity remains a constant. The ability to draw is a crucial part of my identity. It's a part that's not threatened by external factors, It's here to stay.
                <br><br>
                Our conflicts with bad relationships, tragedies and loss often chip away at our individuality. In those times, we seek stability. A foundation that's always there. That is what drawing and creativity is for me. A center of my being. Something I can rely on.
                <br><br>
                Drawing isn't just scribbling around on a piece of paper. The things we create are inspired by what we observe inside us and in our surroundings. It's a powerful tool to convert imagination and ideas into tangible forms that triggers emotions in an audience.
                <br><br>
                People draw to heal, to tell stories, to express joy, hate, love, loss, they draw to escape. Drawing is magical, like a portal via which we see the hidden worlds in our minds and in our society.
                <br><br>
                It's one of the purest forms of expression we have.
                <br><br>
                Strip a society of art and you'd destroy its progress, that's how important it is. This is what I like about drawing and creativity. Because it helps us grow and be a better version of ourselves.
